# Area-Based House Price Predictor

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on the area in square feet. The project utilizes Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.



## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to predict house prices using a simple linear regression model. The model is trained on a dataset that includes the area of the house in square feet and the corresponding price. The relationship between area and price is visualized using a scatter plot, and the model's predictions are shown on the same plot.

## Requirements
